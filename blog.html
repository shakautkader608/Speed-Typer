      <h1>Difference between Local Sotrage and Session Storage.</h1>
      <p>
        The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
        sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is
        loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.Local Storage is not session-based,
        it must be deleted via javascript or manually and Session Storage's' session-based and works per window or tab.
        This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, until the browser is closed.

      <h1>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h1>
      <p>
        Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A global variable has global scope.
        A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. On the other hand, A variable when declared inside
        the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or
        loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
