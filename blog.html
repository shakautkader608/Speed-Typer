      <h1>Difference between Local Sotrage and Session Storage.</h1>
      <p>
        The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
        sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is
        loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time
